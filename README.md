# Open-Source Mine Test Plugin: Speacher Mod

This plugin, designed for the open-source ContentDB plugin library in Minetest, allows players to use "lecture blocks." Once placed and used by a player, the player becomes a lecturer and is the only one able to communicate in a defined area.

This plugin can be useful, especially for recreating an organized working environment in an educational server, for example.
